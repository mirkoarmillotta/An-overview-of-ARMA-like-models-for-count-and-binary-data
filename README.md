replication for the COVID-19 example

Code for the replication of the Application 7 of Armillotta, Luati and Lupparelli.

First, a function for the log-likelihood and the gradient of the log-linear Poisson autoregression is
provided. The code for the other models works in a similar way and it is available
upon request.

Then, a function to perform a the QMLE is presented. Finally, we give
the code for the COVID-19 example and the relative plots. 

The code to perform the PIT is due to Claudia Czado, Tilmann Gneiting, and Leonhard Held. Predictive model assessment for
count data. Biometrics, 65(4):1254â€“1261, 2009. It is available in the reference therein.
